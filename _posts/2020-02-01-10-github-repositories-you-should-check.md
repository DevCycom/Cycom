![Nativefier example ](/img/nativefier-example.gif "Nativefier example")

[Nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier) is a **command-line tool** to easily create a **desktop application for any web site** with succinct and minimal configuration. 

Apps are wrapped by [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) in an OS executable (`.app`,`.exe`, etc.) for use on Windows, macOS and Linux.

You will be able to create an application on your computer for any website you'd like.

* Automatically retrieves the correct icon and app name.
* JavaScript and CSS injection.
* Flash Support (with [`--flash`](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/blob/master/docs/api.md#flash) flag).
* Many more, see the [API docs](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/blob/master/docs/api.md) or `nativefier --help`

**Installation**

npm install nativefier -g
```

Now run it on any website you want

```shell

```

**Oh-My-Zsh** is probably one of the first thing you should install on a new environment. The project is updated frequently and the features are astonishing.

## Gitignore

This is GitHubâ€™s collection of [`.gitignore`](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file templates. We use this list to populate the `.gitignore` template choosers available in the GitHub.com interface when creating new repositories and files.

For more information about how `.gitignore` files work, and how to use them, the following resources are a great place to start:

* The [Ignoring Files chapter](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring) of the [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) book.
* The [Ignoring Files article](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files) on the GitHub Help site.
* The [gitignore](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) manual page.

Every time you start a new project you should go to Github Official [.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore) and download the relevant .gitignore.
