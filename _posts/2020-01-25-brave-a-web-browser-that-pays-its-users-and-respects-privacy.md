The browser that already has more than **8 million users** finally got out of beta and launched its version 1.0. It is the first mainstream browser that pays its users, respects privacy while being user-friendly and fast.

## Why is so Brave different from other browsers ? 

### It is fast - very fast

[Brave](https://brave.com/pri301) has probably given me one of the most awesome browsing experience have ever had. Even thought it is based on Chromium, i've had astounishing results browsing compared to Chrome. 

My daily browser went from Chrome to [Brave](https://brave.com/pri301) without hesitation.
And because [Brave](https://brave.com/pri301) is built on top on chromium, all the plugins I used to have on Chrome are compatible with it.

  
### High anonymity and security

The [Brave](https://brave.com/pri301)'s Shield is probably one of the best option out there to block Ads, Cookies, unwanted script and all.

It allows me to block all the unwanted things that happen behind curtains that we don't see but don't want. It gives me a choice on how much information I want the website to have. 

- **Ad blocking**
- **Fingerprinting prevention**
- **Cookie control**
- **HTTPS upgrading**
- **Block scripts**
- Per-site shield settings
- Configurable global shield defaults
- Send “Do not track” with browsing requests

### Support your favorite sites with Brave Rewards

[Brave](https://brave.com/pri301) introduced an Ethereum based token that rewards user attention. 
It can be safely exchanged between users, publishers and advertisers.

- If a User accepts to see ads, every time he sees an ad he will receive a certain amount of BAT Token.
- The Publisher will receive the major portion of the ad revenue as BAT Token.
- A User can choose to give some of the BAT Tokens that he earned to a publisher that he wants to support.
- A Publisher can also give BAT Tokens to another User or Publisher to promote his work.

Here is an awesome video about the [BAT](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) (Basic Attention Token) to fully understand it by the creator of the Mozilla Foundation, Firefox and Javascript.

Here is a link to the ![basic attention token white paper]({{site.baseurl}}/https://basicattentiontoken.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BasicAttentionTokenWhitePaper-4.pdf)

- You get paid for browsing the web
- You can help publishers by donating BAT Tokens

It makes it the first Browser to use the blockchain technology in its core functionalities.
