Our guide should help you **improve your SEO** and help search engines to show you at the top of the page more quickly.

> It is now essential to write your content following the rules of the web.

Websites with high authority and many backlinks (links to the site)  rank much higher in search results.

**If a website appears on the first page for a query, it receives more clicks, sharing, love, and commitment.**

Having a website not found in the results means that you have no natural traffic. You will have more difficulty selling your product or making money from the ads.\
Implementing an SEO strategy when writing your content is not easy. However, as soon as you understand the basic concepts and apply them to the writing of your content, your natural SEO should improve.

**Beware, increasing your SEO is not an easy thing to implement. It is a process that takes time to implement and requires continuous work. Do not expect to be placed on the first page from the start, but do not despair!**

Writing a blog text or article optimized for SEO depends on many variables. Throughout this article, you will discover the different methods and tools that can help you implement an SEO strategy when writing your articles, product pages, blog articles.

* Use titles and subtitles Add links to your texts Optimize the length of your texts
* Choose your keywords carefully
* Optimize your images
* Create Google Friendly URLs
* Make your content easy to share
* Write high-quality content
* Use headings and subheadings
* Don't hesitate to use titles and subtitles that are easily readable and accessible to Internet users.

## Use titles and subtitles

First of all, this makes your content more easily accessible to a web user. He or she will more effortlessly have an idea of what you are going to talk about in your article.\
But it also makes it easier for search engines to understand the theme of your article/text and thus to better reference you.

**A good quality title indicates to visitors and search engines the essential elements of your paragraph or page.**

Also, be careful to use the "title" tag on your website. This tag allows you to give a name to your page.

For example, in the code of your page :

```html
<title>Blog | How to optimize a text for the SEO </title>
```

Google **restricts the title tag to 600 pixels.** It is equivalent to **60 characters**. Put your keyword at the beginning to increase your natural referencing.

## Add links to your articles/pages.

Search engines such as Google judge the quality of an article or website by the number of links that point to the page/site.

Do not hesitate when writing blog articles if you talk about a tool, a website, a page of your site to put a link to it.

Think about creating an internal mesh of links between your blog articles. You can increase traffic to an old blog article by linking it to it in a new article or by updating it.

The link in the article allows readers to continue browsing other articles on your website.

Links to sites with a very high SEO score also improves your SEO score.

Beware, search engines do not pay as much attention to the "freshness" of an article during referencing.

For the last few years, [Google](https://www.google.com) has been implementing a **"quality vs. quantity"** policy.

It is better to have a quality article but a little older than a more recent article of lower quality.

## Optimize the length of your texts

In the old days, the articles published on the web were not very long. It was mainly a question of writing many articles to be well referenced.

However, in recent years search engines prefer longer content but of better quality.

It is more important for Google to write one article per week/month of **1500-2000** words than to write one article per day of 300-500 words.

Today, the engines emphasize quality and not quantity. The robots that visit websites such as Google, Bing, Qwant have changed in recent years.

## Choose your keywords carefully.

Some people like to settle down and start writing their articles directly, optimizing it for SEO later.

Others prefer to think about primary keywords before they start. 

We recommend this second approach.

You start by identifying the essential keywords that come to your mind, or you use tools like[ Google Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/), [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/) that help you to find the keywords to use on a theme.

## Optimize your images

We often forget about images, but they are much more important than you think. Before you start optimizing your content, don't forget to choose good quality images. A website with good quality images will more easily catch the attention of a web user.

The images on your site also have tags and tags that you need to fill in. An ALT tag on an image allows search engines to understand what the subject of the image is. So don't hesitate to use as many keywords as possible in them.

Pay attention to the size of your images. An image that is too big slows down your site and impacts your natural referencing. It also scares away Internet users because your site will take a long time to load.

Tools like [Squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/) allow you to reduce the size of your images without reducing the quality too much.

## Create Google Friendly URLs

Since 2008, Google has regularly confirmed that the length of a URL must be between 3 and 5 words. The search engine algorithm generally uses the keywords found in the URL to begin to understand the theme of your pages. It is also imperative to make your URLs easily understandable for your users.

For example, which URL will you click on as a user?

1. [primates.dev/blog/how-to-optimize-your-site.html ](https://primates.dev/optimize-your-website-in-a-few-steps/)
2. [primates.dev/blog/?p=123](https://primates.dev/optimize-your-website-in-a-few-steps/)

The second link presented is a link that can be used as a base on Wordpress. Be careful to change your settings to not display on URL type if you use Wordpress for your website.

Wordpress is the most popular CMS (Content Management System) in the world. However, it (and is not the only one) does not implement good SEO practices from the beginning.

## Make your content easily shareable.

You have finally managed to write your article in quality and SEO-optimized ways. Now you need to make it easily shareable.

Don't forget to fill in the meta description of your pages. It makes your articles more easily shareable because a thumbnail of the page appears when the link is shared on a platform.

The user will be able to access a "preview" of your page and a short description that will make them want to click on it or not.

Optimizing your meta descriptions will increase your CTR (Click Through Rate). A proper meta description is probably the simplest way to encourage users to click on your link.

## Write high-quality content

Don't think that SEO is all about making your article appealing to people. A poor quality article won't keep internet users very long.

Search engines take into account the time that people spend on your pages to judge the quality of your pages.
