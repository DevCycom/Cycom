### Setup Github Pages on Fork

Do this step only if you want to be able to visualize your post before making a pull request to the main repo

Then you need to host the Fork on Github Pages

- Go to Settings
- Choose Master Branch
- Don't choose a theme
- Optional: Add a custom domain (follow this [guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site))

If that is successfull then your installation is complete
