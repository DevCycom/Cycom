## Create an Author

You have to create an author first !
Once your author is created then move it to **In Review**


## Create Article

- Start writting your article.
- If the category you are looking for does not exist yet just create one and move it to **In Review**

**If it is your first article, you won't be able to select your author profile in the article author. Don't worry once it is in review we will take care of this**

Don't hesitate to leave us commentaries in the commentary section of your article.

Have fun !
